When you can not implement a functionality in an accessible way, or the effort is too high, is acceptable to implement an alternative version.

But in this case a user with disability (for example a user with motor impairments), using the keyboard only (not with screen reader), is able to focus the previous non-visible element (and the user doesn't know where the focus currently is) and is not able to interact with it (due to its visually hidden CSS settings).

In this case I recommend to use a unique solution using the aria attributes:
- aria-haspopup;
- aria-expanded;
- aria-controls.

You can allow the user to expand the subsection using the enter key of the keyboard instead of choosing the option (using also here the aria-expanded and aria-controls properties) and adding a ""View All $subsection_name"" to allow the user to choose the entire category.

Moreover you can also help the SR users informing him how to interact with the widget (for example using the aria-describedby attribute).\\ *WCAG Success Criterion*: 1.3.1\\ *Element*: \\ *Severity*: medium\\ *Complexity*: average",3 - Support Page and Search Support
